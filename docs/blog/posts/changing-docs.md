# Changing our documentation for the better

Building **meaningful** documentation is important to a project like **rodent** which is why **we decided to change from VitePress to Material for MkDocs**
for the long term.

<!-- more -->

When the project was created on **July 4, 2024,** it was already chosen for the documentation framework to be **VitePress** due to its predecessor, Fungi already
using it to great extent. *So it's a no brainer? We continue to use it as we already have before...*

Several issues came with this as we we're completely rewriting every component which included the documentation that we could take things differently in a direction which will be **simpler and better maintainable** for future and current maintainers.

Believe or not, I have used Material for MkDocs before in some projects as its very simple to setup and create for and only requires **python** *(which is another reason we soon discuss.)* and not NodeJS, Bun, or whatever JavaScript runtime you desire.

Now for our reasons as to why,

- Being able to have both the **Framework and Documentation** under one language allows us for maintainers and contributors to get setup easier.
- Framework was designed to be simple form MkDocs and Material for MkDocs.
- Quick deployments and better optimizations.
- Markdown with less complexity VitePress had.

Overall we hope to utilize **Material for MkDocs** to build a sustainable documentation for as long as we maintain the project.

Thank you for reading have a nice day!
